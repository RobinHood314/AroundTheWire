# AroundTheWire
AroundTheWire is a script (soon to be scripts) that provides a user-friendly interactive interface
to play the OverTheWire and UnderTheWire wargames...
I'll give you the instructions first, and then bore you with the story of this script after
Instructions:
It's quite self-explanatory, I tried to code it so it guides you every step of the way
Ideally, there should be no instructions outside the given instructions provided by the script itself
Story:
The reason I made this script was because I was too lazy (most common reason people invent stuff)
I was playing the OverTheWire wargame, but I did notice that it took some unnecessary time to exit and ssh into a new level
I didn't want to retype the command or bring up the previous command to scroll to change the user
So I decided to try and automate it with a script
First I built a bash script to build multiple bash scripts, one for each level 
(And it was for just one wargame, Bandit which has 34 levels!)
But that had its drawback of having to scroll to change levels, albeit not as much
So then I had the idea of putting all the ssh commands into one script, and then along the line
I decided to make it interactive for user friendliness, also adding the other wargames as I built
Now this was just for the OverTheWire wargames, so I decided to add the UnderTheWire wargames too
Because why not
Hence the name of this script: AroundTheWire, as you can go both OverTheWire and UnderTheWire

Note:
I do not own OverTheWire, UnderTheWire, nor any of the wargames
Nor do I have any affiliation with OverTheWire or UnderTheWire
This script is just meant to provide a user-friendly interface to better enjoy OverTheWire and UnderTheWire
